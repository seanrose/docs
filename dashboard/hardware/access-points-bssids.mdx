## What is a BSSID?

The BSSID is the MAC address associated with an access point’s radio interface. On any client device, you can view the BSSID related to the Wi-Fi broadcast it is connected to.

The BSSID list is helpful to confirm if the BSSID you are connecting to is associated with the Meter network, or something else. For finding your client’s BSSID refer to this KB article: [How to Collect System Information For Meter Support](http://localhost:3000/wifi/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-which-access-point).

Here you will see a list of all of the BSSIDs associated with the Meter network. Along with the SSID, access point, and radio (2.4 or 5 Ghz) that they belong to.

The BSSID list for individual access points can also be found on each access point’s [Insights page](https://support.meter.com/hc/en-us/articles/30713903850509-Hardware-Access-Points-Insights).

If you have any questions about the Network Insights or need further assistance, feel free to contact Meter Support at [support@meter.com](mailto:support@meter.com) or submit a ticket on the Meter Dashboard.
