## What is the purpose of the Meter Speed Test?

The Meter Speed Test will test speeds on your local network from your client device to the Meter Security Appliance. <strong>It does not test speeds to the internet like fast.com or speedtest.net</strong>. Because of this, you will usually see faster speeds on the Meter Speed Test.

For example here is an internet speed test run on the same computer used for the Meter Speed Test shown above (2x difference):

If you are seeing performance issues on your client device - Meter Support may ask you to run the Meter Speed Test to determine if speeds are slow on the local network (not to the internet). This is to determine if any issues in the local environment before you reach the internet. For example, a slowdown in the local environment can be due to wireless interference on a Wi-Fi-connected client, or a bad ethernet connection for a wired client.
