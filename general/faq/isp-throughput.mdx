title: "What is my ISP throughput?"
---

Throughput refers to the amount of data transferred at any moment. For example, a common throughput advertised by ISPs (internet service providers) is 1Gbps - or 1 gigabit per second (equivalent to 1,000mbps).

This speed is the maximum throughput achievable by the ISP’s circuit. If you’d like to see how much throughput you are using - this is available on your Dashboard (dashboard.meter.com)

## Why is seeing my ISP throughput important?

Knowing your regular throughput usage is useful in planning for the future, to ensure your team has adequate bandwidth. For example, if you have a 1Gbps plan from an ISP and see you are normally reaching about 700-800mbps with plans to add more employees; upgrading your ISP would be worthwhile to ensure everyone has the bandwidth they need.
