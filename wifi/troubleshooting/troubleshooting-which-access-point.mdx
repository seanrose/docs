title: Wi-Fi > Troubleshooting [Which Access Point Am I Connected To?]
---

If you are in a busy environment and are noticing poor or slow Wi-Fi performance - it is a good idea to check what Access Point you are connected to. The easiest way to do this is through the Meter Dashboard ([dashboard.meter.com](https://dashboard.meter.com/)).

After logging in, navigate to <strong>Insights > Clients</strong> on the left-hand side. Find your device on the list and click on it. This will expand another menu on the right-hand side. Under ‘Connection’ you will see the name of the Access Point you are connected to.

On the same right-hand side menu - you can also click on ‘View Client’ to see what Access Points your device has connected to in the past.

Once you know what Access Point you are connected to navigate to <strong>Design</strong> > <strong>Floor Plan</strong>.

This will show you the floor plan of your office and the location of the Meter APs.

If your device is connected to an Access Point that is further away from the nearest one to your location - simply toggling Wi-Fi off and back on will force your device to connect to the closer Access Point.

## Why Does This Happen?

Ultimately the decision to move from one Access Point to another is up to the client device see [WiFi Roaming and Sticky Clients](https://support.meter.com/hc/en-us/articles/12161901538317-WiFi-Roaming-and-Sticky-Clients).

Meter Support can adjust Access Point settings to attempt to nudge client devices to make a roaming decision. If you notice that your device continues to connect to a faraway access point - please contact Meter Support at [meter.com/support](http://meter.com/support) for assistance.
