title: Wi-Fi > Troubleshooting [My Wi-Fi Speeds are Slow. What should I do]
---

There are several factors that can contribute to wi-fi speeds. Here are just some of them:

- Distance from the access point
- Obstructions and materials between your device and the access point
- Other environmental variables (such as machinery, and other equipment)
- Channel interference (from other wireless networks)
- The number of clients connected to the same access point

If internet speed tests are slow (ie. speedtest.net, fast.com) - please run the [Meter Speedtest](http://localhost:3000/general/troubleshooting-documentation/meter-speed-test). The Meter Speedtest will test local speeds (not to the internet).

If local speed tests are much quicker than internet speed tests:

Check which access point you are connected to [with this guide](http://localhost:3000/wifi/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-which-access-point). If you are physically closer to a different access point toggle wifi off and on to force your client device to roam.

If you are connected to any VPN please disconnect from the VPN and run the internet speedtest again. There may be an issue with the VPN provider/service that is slowing down your connection to the internet.

If you are not connected to any VPN and are still seeing a large discrepancy between local and internet speed tests - [contact Meter Support](https://support.meter.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as this may indicate an issue with the Internet Service Provider.

If none of the above cases seem to apply there may be some environmental or wireless interference. [Contact Meter Support](https://support.meter.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance.
